This is an implementation of a very basic shell. It accepts input from the command line,
parse it, and run the executable specified. More specfic steps are provided in the shell.c file.

hello.c - Simple C program that contains the source code for the hello executable.
hello - executable that you should be able to run in your shell.
Makefile - Makefile for the shell and hello executable. Run `make shell` and `make hello` respectively.
ref_shell - executable of the solution, for reference. You can run `./ref_shell` in the terminal
            to see the reference shell.
shell.c - Implementation of shell!
